However, such information is not incorporated into most ground‐motion models, including those from Next‐Generation Attenuation projects, which instead use the time‐averaged shear‐wave velocity (VS) in the upper 30 m of the site and sediment depth terms. To facilitate utilization of HVSR, we developed a publicly accessible relational database. This database is adapted from a similar repository for VS data and provides microtremor‐based HVSR data (mHVSR) and supporting metadata, but not parameters derived from the data. Users can interact with the data directly within a web portal that contains a graphical user interface (GUI) or through external tools that perform cloud‐based computations. Within the database GUI, the median horizontal‐component mHVSR can be plotted against frequency, with the mean and mean ± one standard deviation (representing variability across time windows) provided. Using external interactive tools (provided as a Jupyter Notebook and an R script), users can replot mHVSR (as in the database) or create polar plots. These tools can also derive parameters of potential interest for modeling purposes, including a binary variable indicating whether an mHVSR plot contains peaks, as well as the fitted properties of those peaks (frequencies, amplitudes, and widths). Metadata are also accessible, which includes site location, details about the instruments used to make the measurements, and data processing information related to windowing, antitrigger routines, and filtering.","tags":[],"title":"Relational Database for Horizontal‐to‐Vertical Spectral Ratios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine A.

Distributed lifeline infrastructure tends to cover large distances and may cross faults in multiple locations, especially in active tectonic regions like California. However, fault displacement measurements for engineering applications are quite sparse, rendering the development of predictive models extremely difficult and fraught with large uncertainties. Detailed fault surface rupture mapping products exist for a few documented cases, but they may not capture the full width of ground deformations that are likely to impact distributed infrastructure. The 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence presented an ideal opportunity to collect data and evaluate the ability of different techniques to capture coseismic deformations on and near the fault ruptures. Both the M 6.5 and 7.1 events ruptured the surface in sparsely populated desert areas where little vegetation is present to obscure surficial features. Two study areas (~400 m × 500 m each) around the surface ruptures from the two events were selected. Teams of researchers were deployed and coordinated to gather data in three ways: field measurements and photographs, imagery from small uninhabited aerial systems, and imagery from airborne light detection and ranging. Each of these techniques requires different amounts of resources in terms of cost, labor, and time associated with the data collection, processing, and interpretation efforts. This article presents the data collection methods used for the two study areas, and qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the results interpretations. While all three techniques capture the key features that are important for displacement design of distributed infrastructure, the use of remote sensing methods in combination with field measurements presents an advantage over the use of any single technique.","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of Near‐Fault Displacement Interpretations from Field and Aerial Data for the M 6.5 and 7.1 Ridgecrest Earthquake Sequence Ruptures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Paolo Zimmaro","Tatiana Gospe","Sean K.

We collected and uniformly processed 1483 three‐component recordings from an array of 824 sensors spanning 10 seismographic networks. We developed site metadata using available data and multiple models for the time‐averaged shear‐wave velocity in the upper 30 m (VS30) and for basin depth terms. We processed ground motions using Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) procedures and computed intensity measures including spectral acceleration at a number of oscillator periods and inelastic response spectra. We compared elastic and inelastic response spectra to seismic design spectra in building codes to evaluate the damage potential of the ground motions at spatially distributed sites. Residuals of the observed spectral accelerations relative to the NGA‐West2 ground‐motion models (GMMs) show good average agreement between observations and model predictions (event terms between about −0.3 and 0.5 for peak ground acceleration to 5 s). The average attenuation with distance is also well captured by the empirical NGA‐West2 GMMs, although azimuthal variations in attenuation were observed that are not captured by the GMMs. An analysis considering directivity and fault‐slip heterogeneity for the M 7.1 event demonstrates that the dispersion in the near‐source ground‐motion residuals can be reduced.","tags":[],"title":"Engineering Characteristics of Ground Motions Recorded in the 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquake Sequence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott J.

Most existing approaches lack quantitative methods for estimating the impact of bus lanes or for optimizing the operation of bus lanes at a system level. This paper proposes a novel optimization approach for allocating road space to bus lanes in cities. The approach determines the optimal space share between the modes in service and allocates the bus lanes by integrating strategies that lead to less total travel cost. By relying on recent advances in network-level traffic flow modeling, namely, the multimodal macroscopic fundamental diagram (mMFD), the approach captures multimodal traffic dynamics and travel costs by mode. The impact of a bus lane on mode usage is taken into account to aggregated mode shift phenomena under changes in layout of dedicated bus lanes. Simulation was performed in a Swiss city network to test the proposed optimization approach. The research found that (a) the mMFD could be properly integrated to decide for road space optimization of large-scale multimodal urban networks, (b) an optimal and efficient space share minimized the total travel cost for all users, and (c) the best strategy for the studied network was to implement the allocated space on the connected links on a corridor rather than to assign them sparsely to the links that are heavily congested.","tags":[],"title":"Macroscopic Approach for Optimizing Road Space Allocation of Bus Lanes in Multimodal Urban Networks Through Simulation Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Jonathan P Stewart","Yousef Bozorgnia","David M Boore","Tadahiro Kishida"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642534371,"objectID":"ffa1a28693e5b0a0a9d5b607f8b10f4f","permalink":"https://wltcwpf.github.io/publication/wang-2017-r/","publishdate":"2022-01-18T19:32:51.523612Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2017-r/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"R Package for Computation of Earthquake Ground Motion Response Spectra","type":"publication"}]
