Non-ergodic site response can be evaluated from the interpretation of ground motions recorded at (or near) the site or from simu-lations. The simulation method that is most frequently employed is ground response analysis, which can capture impedance, resonance, and nonlinear effects for vertically propagating shear waves. Such effects are often large contributors to site response, but are not sole contributors, as other effects related to basin geometry can also be influential, particularly at long oscillator periods. We review procedures for conducting ground motion hazard analysis using non-ergodic site response models, including aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty. We de-scribe preliminary new work related to spatial correlation of site response that is important for some applications. The challenges and benefits of applying these procedures are illustrated through case histories in California, Italy, and Japan.","tags":null,"title":"Applications of non-ergodic site response in ground motion modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan P Stewart","Scott J Brandenberg","Pengfei Wang","Chukwuebuka C Nweke","Kenneth Hudson","Silvia Mazzoni","Yousef Bozorgnia","Ucla A Christine Goulet","Kenneth W Hudnut","Usgs A Craig Davis","Farzin Zareian","Jawad Fayaz","Uc D Irvine Richard Koehler","Colin Chupik","Ian Pierce","Alana Williams","Martin B Hudson","Wood Tadahiro Kishida","Ben Brooks","Ryan Gold","Dan Ponti","Katherine Scharer","Devin McPhillips","Chris DuRoss","Todd Ericksen","Janis Hernandez","Jay Patton","Brian Olson","Tim Dawson","Jerome Treiman","California Geological Survey Kelly Blake","Jeffrey Bachhuber","Chris Madugo","Joseph Sun","Andrea Donnellan","Greg Lyzenga","Erik Conway","Jonathan P Stewart","Elizabeth Cochran","Alex Grant","Eric Thompson","Alan Yong","Jamie Steidl","David M Boore","Katherine Kendrick","Shane Detweiler","Andrew Lyda","Sean Yeung Assistance from Omar Issa","Tristan Buckreis","Zhengxiang Yi","Shawn Barker","Raymond Becker","Searles Valley Domestic Water","Ken Santini","Albert Kottke","Katie Herr","Chris Hitchcock","Ozgur Kozaci","Jeff Keaton","Wyatt Iwanaga","Xiafeng Meng","David Frost","Fangzhou Liu","Georgia Tech"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"a22c34b30d03f4bdbf7ddc9edf5cf914","permalink":"https://wltcwpf.github.io/publication/stewart-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T20:04:23.581948Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stewart-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The Ridgecrest Earthquake sequence included a foreshock event on July 4 2019 (M6.4) and a M7.1 mainshock event on July 5 2019.

GEER has partnered with several organizations to collect perishable data and document the important impacts of these events, including the US Geological Survey, the California Geological Survey, the US Navy, the Southern California Earthquake Center, and local utilities. Critical geotechnical features of this event are extensive left-lateral (M6.4 event) and right-lateral (M7.1 event) surface ruptures over fault segments of variable complexity and width as well as across extensional and compressive step-over zones. We also document lifeline performance at fault crossings (gas, water, electrical), mainshock slip and afterslip, liquefaction and lateral spreading features, and liquefaction effects on structures. These effects are documented using field (ground) mapping and aerial imagery that will support subsequent development of high-resolution digital elevation models. Over 1200 ground motions were recorded from the foreshock and mainshock alone, with many additional aftershock records.

The event had a hypocentral depth of 35 km, centered beneath the port city of Tomakomai. Extremely strong shaking with peak ground acceleration in excess of 0.5 g was felt in the communities directly north of Tomakomai, in the districts of Abira and Atsuma. There, a very high density of landslides occurred in pumices soil that affected the majority of slopes in the region above the floodplain. These landslides were typically a thin veneer of 1 to 3 m of recent (textless9000 ybp) volcanic pumice mantling older Kawabata marine sedimentary rocks. The source of the pumice layers are recent eruptions from Mt. Tarumae, south of Shikotsu-ko Caldera lake. Several block megaslides were observed in the Kawabata marine unit. A flow failure resulting from soil collapse or liquefaction was observed in fill deposits placed in a residential community district of Kiyota ward in Sapporo. The community, Satozuka-1 is situated on a natural steep ravine that was filled with pumice soil to level construction area to a gently sloping landscape for housing construction. The flow failure consisted of lateral migration of soil from the upper slope regions of the community onto the surface of the lower community. The upper community topographically deflated as large quantities of fluidized soil flooded the lower streets.","tags":null,"title":"Seismological, Geological, and Geotechnical Engineering Aspects of the 2018 MW 6.6 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Paolo Zimmaro","Sean K Ahdi","Dong Youp Kwak","Jonathan P Stewart"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"8000030bccdc23fe3a117b06dbcf385e","permalink":"https://wltcwpf.github.io/publication/wang-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T20:17:40.757059Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This project was comprised of two distinct yet mutually beneficial tasks. The first was the establishment of a United States Community VS Profile Database (PDB). The second involved the use of that database to support ground motion studies that establish observation-based site response at ground motion recording stations and then seek to establish the degree to which it can be estimated using alternate prediction approaches. The development of the PDB has been, and continues as, a major multi-institutional effort to develop an open-access VS profile database for sites in the United States. The data described herein was collected from diverse sources that include consulting engineering reports from private industry, university research reports and other documents, federal open-file and similar reports, California state agency documents, and reports provided by electric utilities for selected sites. All data are strictly within the public domain, but much of it was for practical purposes inaccessible to most potential users. The VS data sources encompass a wide array of geophysical techniques, are presented in many different formats, and are accompanied by widely divergent supplementary data, including P-wave velocities, geotechnical logs and other data, and penetration test data. A relational database schema of sufficient breadth and flexibility was developed to accommodate this diverse data set. The data are digitized and otherwise prepared in the standardized format specified by the database schema. A web interface (www.uclageo.com/VPDB) was developed for data query, visualization, and download. This resource is anticipated to be useful to geotechnical engineers and engineering seismologists for diverse applications in research and industry practice. We derive non-ergodic site response for California sites using an expanded version of the NGA-West2 database. We then investigate the degree to which different site response analysis methods capture observations. An ergodic site term conditioned on time-averaged shear wave velocity in the upper 30 m of sites (VS30) and basin depth provides a baseline against which other models are compared. In this study, we have investigated two site-specific models: ground response analysis (GRA) and square root impedance (SRI) method. These analyses are performed for sites meeting certain data availability requirements pertaining to number of recorded events and availability of site-specific VS measurements from the PDB. We describe procedures developed to implement each approach, including protocols developed to assign unknown soil parameters. We describe a series of representative results for site with and without good fits of model predictions to observations. We compile results across sites to identify parameters that influence the effectiveness of ground response analyses and the epistemic uncertainty associated with different methods of site response prediction.","tags":null,"title":"Shear Wave Velocity Database and Its Application for Analysis of Non-Ergodic Site Amplification Effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Jonathan Stewart","Yousef Bozorgnia","David M Boore","Tadahiro Kishida"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"9a3dbd8306e7cf5419b8c436281935fd","permalink":"https://wltcwpf.github.io/publication/wang-2017/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T20:04:23.582701Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Earthquake ground motions are typically recorded with one vertical and two horizontal components. It has become standard practice to represent the horizontal component of ground shaking in a manner that recognizes a range of amplitudes with changing azimuths. These variable amplitudes can be generically denoted RotDxx, where xx indicates the percentile of the horizontal amplitude range. RotDxx representations of ground motion are used with amplitude parameters (peak acceleration and velocity) as well as response spectral ordinates for a range of oscillator periods. The use of RotDxx ground motions was introduced in the NGA-West2 project, and analysis procedures for their computation were originally developed in Fortran by the fourth author of this report. Here we describe the implementation of these analysis procedures in R, resulting in an “R” package referred to as Rotated Combination of Two-Component ground motions (RCTC). We describe related algorithms for recovering accurate peak quantities from digital data (i.e., Sincinterpolation and subset selection), which are also implemented in RCTC. We verify the code outputs by comparing them with a prior Fortran code. RCTC takes as input two horizontal components of ground motion, their azimuths, and their time step, and returns various types of variables, including pseudo spectral acceleration for each horizontal component, RotDxx for xx=0, 50, 100% as well as earlier, orientation-independent, geometric mean parameter GMRotI50. Other period-independent variables are also computed and outputted. We document here the code verification and provide instructions for its use.","tags":null,"title":"\"R\" Package for Computation of Earthquake Ground Motion Response Spectra","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nan Zheng","Takao Dantsuji","Pengfei Wang","Nikolas Geroliminis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"3cdeaa4271b53f3083a9cd6b787ae292","permalink":"https://wltcwpf.github.io/publication/zheng-2017/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T20:04:23.586265Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zheng-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Although multimodality has been widely studied in the literature, planning and operating bus lanes in congested urban city centers are still challenging topics for researchers and policy makers. Most existing approaches lack quantitative methods for estimating the impact of bus lanes or for optimizing the operation of bus lanes at a system level. This paper proposes a novel optimization approach for allocating road space to bus lanes in cities. The approach determines the optimal space share between the modes in service and allocates the bus lanes by integrating strategies that lead to less total travel cost. By relying on recent advances in network-level traffic flow modeling, namely, the multimodal macroscopic fundamental diagram (mMFD), the approach captures multimodal traffic dynamics and travel costs by mode. The impact of a bus lane on mode usage is taken into account to aggregated mode shift phenomena under changes in layout of dedicated bus lanes. Simulation was performed in a Swiss city network to test the proposed optimization approach. The research found that (a) the mMFD could be properly integrated to decide for road space optimization of large-scale multimodal urban networks, (b) an optimal and efficient space share minimized the total travel cost for all users, and (c) the best strategy for the studied network was to implement the allocated space on the connected links on a corridor rather than to assign them sparsely to the links that are heavily congested.","tags":null,"title":"Macroscopic approach for optimizing road space allocation of bus lanes in multimodal urban networks through simulation analysis","type":"publication"}]
