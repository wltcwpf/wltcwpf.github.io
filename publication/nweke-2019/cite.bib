 abstract = {We investigate benefits of regionalizing basin response in ergodic ground motion models. Using southern California data, we find average responses between basin structures, even when the primary site variables used in ground motion models (VS30 and depth parameters) are controlled for. For example, the average site response in relatively modestly sized sedimentary structures (such as Simi Valley) are under-predicted at short periods by current models, whereas underprediction occurs at long periods for larger sedimentary structures. Moreover, site-to-site withinevent standard deviations vary appreciably between large basins, basin edges, smaller valleys, and non-basin (mountainous) locations. Such variations can appreciably impact aleatory variability.},
