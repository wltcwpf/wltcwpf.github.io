 abstract = {Following the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, consisting of an M 6.4 foreshock and M 7.1 mainshock along with many other events, the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance association deployed a team to gather perishable data. The team focused their efforts on documenting ground deformations including surface fault rupture south of the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, and liquefaction features in Trona and Argus. The team published a report within two weeks of the M 7.1 mainshock. This article presents data products gathered by the team, which are now published and publicly accessible. The data products presented herein include ground-based observations using Global Positioning System trackers, digital cameras, and hand-measuring devices, as well as unmanned aerial vehicle-based imaging products using Structure from Motion to create point clouds and digital surface models. The article describes the data products, as well as tools available for interacting with the products.},
